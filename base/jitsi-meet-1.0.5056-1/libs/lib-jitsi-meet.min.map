Which means that even if the next message \"C\" is\n * the same as \"A\" it will start a new aggregated message \"C\".\n * @param {function()} logStorage.isReady a method which should return\n * a <tt>boolean</tt> to tell the collector that it's ready to store. During the\n * time storage is not ready log batches will be cached and stored on the next\n * occasion (flush or interval timeout).\n *\n * @param {Object} options the <tt>LogCollector</tt> configuration options.\n * @param {number} options.maxEntryLength the size limit for a single log entry\n * to be stored. The <tt>LogCollector</tt> will push the entry as soon as it\n * reaches or exceeds this limit given that <tt>logStorage.isReady</tt>\n * returns <tt>true</tt>. Otherwise the log entry will be cached until the log\n * storage becomes ready. Note that the \"is ready\" condition is checked every\n * <tt>options.storeInterval</tt> milliseconds.\n * @param {number} options.storeInterval how often the logs should be stored in\n * case <tt>maxEntryLength</tt> was not exceeded.\n * @param {boolean} options.stringifyObjects indicates whether or not object\n * arguments should be \"stringified\" with <tt>JSON.stringify</tt> when a log\n * message is composed.
